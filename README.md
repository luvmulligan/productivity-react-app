# productivity-react-app
A React web application where you can white To Do items, mark them as complete and delete them. 

You can view the demo here: https://my-react-app-jlgqd5m4i.now.sh/

First, you can delete the examples to get a clean To Do List. 

Then write your task in the text field and press Submit or Enter. 
You can press the checkbox to the left of the task to mark it as complete. 
You can delete the task with the X button on the right. 

Add as many tasks as you need! 

The app was developed fully in React and uses Bootstrap, Font-Awesome and Google Fonts.
